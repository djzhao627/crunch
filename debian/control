Description: tool for creating wordlist
 Crunch is a wordlist generator where you can specify a standard
 character set or any set of characters to be used in generating
 the wordlists. The wordlists are created through combination and
 permutation of a set of characters. You can determine the amount
 of characters and list size.
 .
 This program supports numbers and symbols, upper and lower case
 characters separately and Unicode.
